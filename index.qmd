I'm a data manager/programmer at Simulations Plus in the Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics Solutions business unit. In this role, I leverage my familiarity with R to process data, create figures, and generate dataset documentation. I enjoy developing tools and solutions in R that not only optimize workflows but also contribute to advancing data-driven approaches.
